## Distributed Web Infrastructure Design

**Website**: www.foobar.com  
**DNS A Record**: www.foobar.com â†’ Load Balancer IP (8.8.8.8)

### Components:
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**: Distributes traffic to app servers using Round Robin.
- **2 Servers (Web + App Servers)**: Nginx + App server + Application files.
- **Database (MySQL)**: One Primary (write) DB. Optional Replica (read scaling).

### Load Balancer:
- **Algorithm**: Round Robin
- **Setup**: Active-Active
  - Both app servers handle traffic simultaneously.
  - Ensures better utilization and performance.

### Database Cluster:
- **Primary**: Handles all writes.
- **Replica**: Handles reads (optional).
- **Replication**: Asynchronous or semi-sync to avoid write bottlenecks.

### Key Concepts:
- **Active-Active**: Multiple servers run concurrently.
- **Active-Passive**: Only one server handles traffic; the other is on standby.
- **SPOF**: Load balancer must be replicated or redundant to avoid system failure.
- **DNS Record www**: An A record that maps www.foobar.com to the server IP.

### Limitations:
- Load balancer is a SPOF.
- No HTTPS or firewall = security vulnerabilities.
- No monitoring = hard to detect issues or scale.
