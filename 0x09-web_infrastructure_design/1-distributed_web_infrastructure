## Simple Web Infrastructure Design

**User Request Flow:**
User types `www.foobar.com` → DNS resolves to `8.8.8.8` → Nginx → App Server → Database

**Components (All on 1 server):**
- Web Server: Nginx
- App Server: Gunicorn/PHP-FPM
- Application Files: Codebase (backend/frontend)
- Database: MySQL
- Domain Name: foobar.com
- DNS Record: A record for www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8

**Explanations:**
- Server: Machine hosting all services.
- Domain Name: Maps human-readable URL to IP.
- DNS Record: 'www' is an A record pointing to the server.
- Web Server: Handles HTTP(S) and routes traffic to app.
- App Server: Runs code and handles logic.
- Database: Stores persistent structured data.
- Protocol: HTTP/S over TCP/IP connects user to server.

**Limitations:**
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- Downtime during maintenance or deployment
- Cannot handle large scale traffic (no auto-scaling or redundancy)
